# Easybank Landing Page

This project is a challenge by Frontend Mentor, coded by Nadia Zubko.

## Overview

The Easybank landing page is a responsive and accessible website implementation. It accurately reproduces the design provided by Frontend Mentor while ensuring full accessibility and optimal display across all device sizes.

The implementation allowed me to refine my SCSS and HTML expertise and demonstrate rapid development capabilities. Furthermore, I was able to successfully extrapolate tablet and mobile layouts without explicit design specifications. This project was an excellent exercise to hone practical coding skills.
